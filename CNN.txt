CNN = Convocutional Neural Network
For Mathematics - Numpy  [small work]
                - Theano [complex work]
				
Keras is a modified version of tensorflow. Keras can use tensorflow, theano
dog/cat Classifier by CNN = Keras

In CNN, each neuron will send data to every neuron of next hidden layer
For working on ANN -gpu is not a must
but for CNN gpu is must. CNN was designed for image classification or img processing [advance version of opencv]
For CNN min gpu requirement = 2GB gpu
10,000 images for processing


IN ANN - from output to input = Back Propagation
       - from input to output = Forward propagation
